## mp3 to midi
https://github.com/BShakhovsky/PolyphonicPianoTranscription

https://github.com/LIMUNIMI/MMSP2021-Audio2ScoreAlignment

https://github.com/DamRsn/NeuralNote

https://basicpitch.spotify.com/

the last 2 seems promising, they are the same project

## midi to sheet
https://github.com/BYVoid/MidiToSheetMusic

## midi to finger style
https://github.com/noahbaculi/guitar-tab-generator/?tab=readme-ov-file

https://noahbaculi.com/guitartab

https://github.com/natecdr/tuttut/


## video(highly optional) 
no current tool

## playback tab:
http://www.tofret.com/tablature-player.php


# Test1(Manual)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWGay8FGVLk

use this as input

extract to midi using basic_pitch

use tuttut to convert it into tab

result: really weird, glitch, i guess it is because imperfection in midi or something,also tuttut is not build for complex stuff. Note: we also need to account for the speed the players play to compare representation

## problem
